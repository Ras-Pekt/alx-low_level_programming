# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
This directory contains functions on bitwise manipulation in C. The functions do the following:

[binary_to_uint](0-binary_to_uint.c) - converts a binary number to an unsigned int

[print_binary](1-print_binary.c) - prints the binary representation of a number

[get_bit](2-get_bit.c) - returns the value of a bit at a given index

[set_bit](3-set_bit.c) - sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index

[clear_bit](4-clear_bit.c) - sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index

[flip_bits](5-flip_bits.c) - returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
